After studying for a year at the Miami Acting Studio and working in commercials she decided to make the move to The Big Apple. Adria moved to New York in 2011 to study at the very famous Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute Two Year Conservatory Program. In those two years she grew as an actor and worked in short films and is now currently filming a feature film. Soon after graduating Adria got signed by Phoenix Artist Agency and is currently working with them. Adria's ultimate need as an actor is to make the audience connect to every character she plays. She likes to convince herself the word \"Acting\" isn't in the dictionary and that instead its called re-experiencing. \" People feed my creativity it's where I get the energy to be creative. They are my best resource. They are my Method. As an actor I believe that the art of observing is as important as the art of creating\". - Adria Arjona.\n",
