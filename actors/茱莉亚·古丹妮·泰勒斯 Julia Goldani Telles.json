It was also there that she was introduced to the world of ballet. When the family relocated to New York City, at age 6, Telles could only speak Portuguese and learned English after the family's move. Telles attends Professional Children's School in Manhattan\u3000\u3000She began dancing in Brazil at the age of 5 before training professionally at the School of American Ballet and Ballet Academy East. She appeared in numerous ballet performances including Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker, Don Quixote and Swan Lake. A groin injury at the age of 15 had an important role in her fast success. She was forced to stop practicing ballet for a year, and to avoid depression, she decided to take a drama course. Her agent felt Bunheads should have been one of her first auditions as he felt she would be comfortable with the dancing aspect of the show.\n",
