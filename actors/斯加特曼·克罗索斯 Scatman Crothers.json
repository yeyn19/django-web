He performed in many clubs and on radio shows in the '20s,'30s, and '40s before making the move to television in 1948. But once he moved to acting, Crothers stayed busy the remainder of his life. He had roles in such series as The Governor and J.J., Kojak, Toma, and One of the Boys. He was also active as a voice for such cartoon series as Hong Kong Phooey and The Harlem Globetrotters. ~ Ron Wynn, Rovi\n",
