    "intro": ")   \u3000\u3000IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is unquestionably on my top 3 from the many sci-fi movies made in the 1950s. I review many sci-fi films from the 50s, both B-movies AND classic. THIS film would definitely go down as one of the all-time classics. Even more rich with every viewing, IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE is about a couple who live in a desert, one a scientist. One night, the scientist and his girlfriend are stargazing when they see some strange thing crash into a crater. When they go there, the scientist decides to go down, and sees a strange ship right before an avalanche falls over the specimen. Soon those two are the only ones who believe it is a ship from outer space, until strange things begin happening. The scientist must solve the mystery of why the aliens have arrived, and what they want. A science fiction classic worth buying on DVD. (Don't be fooled...the alien looks nothing like the one on the DVD cover.)  ",
