But Vogler's greater film career really started with The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty (1972) and Alice in the Cities (1974), both directed by Wim Wenders. The creative partnership of Vogler and Wenders lasted for nearly 20 years. R\u00fcdiger Vogler also played in various German TV series, such as Tatort, Derrick and Der Alte. Vogler lives in Paris and in Mittelbuch near Biberach an der Ri\u00df.\u3000\u3000Vogler is most often recognized for his collaboration with director Wim Wenders. In several Wenders films Vogler's character name is Philip Winter, although Winter's occupation changes from film to film. Such films include Alice in the Cities, Kings of the Road, Faraway, So Close!, Until the End of the World and Lisbon Story. The Wrong Move is the only Wenders film starring R\u00fcdiger Vogler where Vogler's character has a different last name, Wilhelm. Most of the Winter characters, as well as the Wilhelm character in The Wrong Move, are film technicians, including a photographer (Alice in the Cities), a writer (The Wrong Move), a movie theater repairman (Kings of the Road), and a motion picture sound engineer (Lisbon Story).\n",
